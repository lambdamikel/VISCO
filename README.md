# VISCO
A Visual Spatial Query Language written in Common Lisp &amp; CLIM for its GUI

## About

This was written from 1997 - 1998. The program described in my diploma theses.  
Check out [the VISCO home page](https://www.michael-wessel.info/visco.html) for details.

Unfortunately, this really requires ACL CLIM 2, for which I don't have a license, so I cannot test it. 
LispWorks 6.1 CLIM gives me a Segmentation Violation when it encounters the `define-application-frame` :-(
